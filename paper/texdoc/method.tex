\section{Procedure}
\label{procedure}
More than 250 computers were profiled for system resource allocation 
and utilization. The profiling was carried out for both local and network 
accounts. For the two types of accounts, I profiled the systems at login 
after they have been idle or restarted. In other to reproduce end-user 
experience, the profiling script was set up to lauch at login, taking 
continous snapshots for 35 minutes.  The subprocess class and its Popen 
constructor in Python (version 3.6)~\cite{python366} was used to start, time, 
and exit the top command[citation]. The profiled computers had either the 
Mac OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion, the OS X 10.9 Mavericks, the OS X 10.11 El 
Captain or the macOS 10.12 Sierra operating system. We profiled computers 
from one classroom to the other, lebelling the log files to account for 
the date of data collection, the classroom and the computer inventory tag. 
A trunck directory and subdirectories were then created with each subdirectory 
named after the classroom from which profile data was collected. A copy of the 
trunck directory was saved for reference and future need before the log files 
were cleaned up and computer resource metrics extracted.
